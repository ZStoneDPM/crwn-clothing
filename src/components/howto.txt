adding new functions:

first add redux level types
then redux level actions
then redux level reducer

then integrate into component from actions level


>>>

selector is for memoizing items using 'reselect' and properly
integrating in mapStateToProps functions

import { createSelector } from 'reselect';

const selectShop = state => state.shop;

export const selectShopItems = createSelector(
    [selectShop],
    shop => shop.shopItems
)

the utilities is used when an object needs to be split in such
a way that it can be converted into a function that can be 
returned in the reducer, rather than filling the reducer with
such functions
