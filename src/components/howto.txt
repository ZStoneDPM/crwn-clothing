adding new functions:

first add redux level types
then redux level actions
then redux level reducer

then integrate into component from actions level


>>>

integrating in mapStateToProps functions

the utilities is used when an object needs to be split in such
a way that it can be converted into a function that can be 
returned in the reducer, rather than filling the reducer with
such functions
